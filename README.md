## 📖 Overview

**IGL-AI** (In-Game Leader AI) is a real-time tactical assistant that "watches" your Valorant gameplay and provides live, radiant-level coaching strategies. 

Unlike static overlays, IGL-AI uses **Google Gemini 3's multimodal vision capabilities** to analyze the game state (Agent, Spike Status, Phase, and Position) and generate concise, tactical audio commands instantly. It acts as a grounded "Backseat Gamer" that actually helps you win.

## ⚡ Key Features

* **🧠 Multimodal Perception**: Captures your screen in real-time and uses Gemini 3 Flash to "see" the battlefield.
* **🗣️ Live Audio Coaching**: Converts tactical text strategies into speech using system TTS (PowerShell integration).
* **🛡️ Hallucination Filters**: Custom Java logic gates prevent the AI from inventing fake game states (e.g., stopping "Defuse" calls when you are Attacking).
* **👁️ Computer Vision Sensors**:
    * **Hybrid Agent Detection**: Includes a "Neural Link" Launcher to manually select your agent (Jett, Reyna, Omen, etc.) or uses experimental Computer Vision to auto-detect agents like Sage/Neon.
    * **Phase Detection**: automatically detects if the Spike is planted or if the round is in the combat phase.
* **💻 Cyberpunk Launcher**: A custom JavaFX control panel for immersive startup and configuration.
* **🖥️ Transparent Overlay**: Displays the AI's "Thought Process" and confidence levels directly on top of your game.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language**: Java 21
* **Framework**: JavaFX (UI & Overlay)
* **AI Model**: Google Gemini 3 Flash Preview (via REST API)
* **JSON Parsing**: `org.json`
* **System Integration**: `java.awt.Robot` (Screen Capture) & PowerShell (TTS)

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
1.  **Java Development Kit (JDK) 21** installed.
2.  **Maven** (for dependency management).
3.  A **Google AI Studio API Key**.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/IGL-AI.git](https://github.com/yourusername/IGL-AI.git)
cd IGL-AI
Step 2: Set your API Key
Security Warning: NEVER share your API key or commit it to GitHub. Set it as an Environment Variable on your machine:

Windows (PowerShell):

PowerShell
$env:GEMINI_API_KEY="AIzaSy...YourKeyHere"
Mac/Linux:

Bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="AIzaSy...YourKeyHere"
Step 3: Dependencies
Ensure your pom.xml includes the org.json and javafx dependencies. If you are using IntelliJ, simply reload the Maven project.

🎮 How to Run
Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.

Locate src/main/java/org/example/Launcher.java.

Right-click Launcher.java and select Run 'Launcher.main()'.

The Neural Link Launcher will appear:

Select your Agent (e.g., SAGE) or leave on AUTO.

Click INITIALIZE SYSTEM.

Alt-Tab into Valorant.

The AI will begin coaching you automatically!

⚠️ Troubleshooting
"API Key Missing": Make sure you set the environment variable correctly in your Run Configuration or System Settings.

Overlay not showing: Ensure you run Valorant in Windowed Fullscreen mode so the JavaFX overlay can sit on top.

Auto-Detect failing: The "AUTO" agent feature relies on specific HUD coordinates (1080p). If it fails, use the Dropdown in the Launcher to manually select your agent.

Audio issues: The system uses PowerShell for TTS. Ensure your Windows volume is up.

Fair Play: This tool is a Proof of Concept for the Gemini 3 Hackathon. It reads the screen visually (like a human) and does not hook into game memory or read network packets. However, use in competitive ranked matches is at your own risk.

🏆 Hackathon Context
This project explores the Multimodal Grounding capabilities of Gemini 3. By combining specific pixel-color sensors (Java) with general visual reasoning (Gemini), we solved the common "LLM Hallucination" problem in fast-paced gaming environments.

Created for the Gemini 3 Global Challenge.
